# PDS4 Local Data Dictionary Management

This repo contains tools and software needed for managing PDS4 Local Data Dictionaries

## Prerequisites

Python 3.13.


## User Quickstart

Install with:

    pip install pds.ldd-manager


To execute, run:

    ldd-generate --help
    ldd-validate --help
    ldd-release --help


## Code of Conduct

All users and developers of the NASA-PDS software are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this to ensure you understand the expectations of our community.


## Development

To develop this project, use your favorite text editor, or an integrated development environment with Python support, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


### Contributing

For information on how to contribute to NASA-PDS codebases please take a look at our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Documentation

Your project should use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to build its documentation. PDS' documentation template is already configured as part of the default build. You can build your projects docs with:

    sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build

You can access the build files in the following directory relative to the project root:

    docs/build/index.html


## Build

    pip install build
    python3 -m build .


## Publication

NASA PDS packages can publish automatically using the [Roundup Action](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action), which leverages GitHub Actions to perform automated continuous integration and continuous delivery. A default workflow that includes the Roundup is provided in the `.github/workflows/unstable-cicd.yaml` file. (Unstable here means an interim release.)


### Manual Publication

Create the package:

    pip install build
    python3 -m build .

Publish it as a Github release.

Publish on PyPI (you need a PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload dist/*

Or publish on the Test PyPI (you need a Test PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*


## CI/CD

The template repository comes with our two "standard" CI/CD workflows, `stable-cicd` and `unstable-cicd`. The unstable build runs on any push to `main` (Â± ignoring changes to specific files) and the stable build runs on push of a release branch of the form `release/<release version>`. Both of these make use of our GitHub actions build step, [Roundup](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action). The `unstable-cicd` will generate (and constantly update) a SNAPSHOT release. If you haven't done a formal software release you will end up with a `v0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` release (see NASA-PDS/roundup-action#56 for specifics).
